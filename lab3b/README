DESCRIPTION OF FILES INCLUDED:

In the lab3b-404926523.tar.gz there is
- A lab3b.py that takes in a .csv file with file system descriptions and parses through it to find any file system inconsistencies.
  The checker performs block consistency audits, i-node allocation audits and directory consistency audits. It is assumed that the file
  system is within one group.

- A Makefile included that
  - default: creates a symlink to the python code and prints a sucess message
  - clean: removes all files created by the Makefile
  - dist: creates a tarball

- A README with a description of the files and list of sources used.

TESTING METHODOLOGY:

Testing was done incrementally by using each individual corrupted CSV file provided by the sanity script.
Sections of the file consistency checker were done at a time according to the provided sections of the spec.
