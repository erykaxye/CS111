DESCRIPTION OF FILES INCLUDED:
In the lab0-404920875.tar.gz there is 
- A .c file holding the C code called lab0.c. This file takes different arguments and reads and writes to either stdin/stdout or specified files depending on the arguments inputted. There is also a choice of created a segmentation fault in the code and a signal handler that catches the segmentation fault.  
- A Makefile included that compiles the .c file, runs a smoke-test, removes all files created by the Makefile, and creates a tarball.
- 2 screenshots of gdb sessions. 



SMOKE-TEST CASES:
I included test cases for each exit code.
For exit(0), I run correct command that uses --input and --output which results in an exit code of 0.
For exit(1), I run a command with an argument that is not recognized --wrong which results in the exit code of 1.
For exit(2), I run --input for a file that doesn't exist which results in an exit code of 2.
For exit(3), I write protect a file and try to write to it with --output which results in the exit code of 3.
For exit(4), I write a correct command with --segfault --catch that results in an exit code of 4.
