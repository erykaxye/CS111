DESCRIPTION OF FILES INCLUDED:
In the lab1b-404920875.tar.gz there is
- A lab1b-client.c file that creates a socket that connects to a server and writes bytes. There is an option for log which logs all the bytes sent across the socket and a compressed option that compresses the bytes sent across the socket. 
- A lab1b-server.c file that receives bytes from the socket and sends it to a shell to process the command and send its back through the socket. There is also an option for compressed in the server. 
- A Makefile included that compiles all the .c files, removes all files created by the Makefile, and creates a tarball.
